# Python for Data Science, AI, & Development

🐍 Python for Data Science, AI & Development 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I've documented my journey through the IBM course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai">Python for Data Science, AI, & Development</a>. In this hands-on project, I delve into the world of Python programming, exploring its applications in data science and artificial intelligence.

Feel free to explore the code, or use it as a reference for your Python learning journey. Happy coding! 🚀
